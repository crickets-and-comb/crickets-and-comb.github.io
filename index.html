        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We’re Crickets and Comb &mdash; a team who build custom open-source tools for nonprofits, and make sure the folks using them feel supported every step of the way. We care about clarity, ease of use, real-world impact &mdash; and keeping things secure, maintained, and steadily improving.</p>
        <p>When we build something useful, we share it. Many of our tools grow into resources for the wider open-source community. We stay grounded in collaboration and mentorship, working with people near and far to learn, teach, and create together. It takes care and commitment to keep things running well, and we’re here for it.</p>

He took the time to understand our processes and built us a tool that expedites our work and removes room for human error. He’s been patient with our lack of technology fluency and has been quick to respond to questions and requests to further improve the new methods. Thanks to Crickets and Comb, we’re working smarter and saving time.”</p>

                    <p class="mb-3">“Prior to implementing the program that Kaleb custom built for our team, we were spending 4-6 hours a week performing tedious, repetitive computer tasks. Not only was this not time well spent, but it also left us vulnerable to human error. Kaleb's tool has reduced our labor to 30 minutes and (possibly most importantly) has eliminated the risk of human error. He took the time to fully understand our process. He listened carefully to our needs and was receptive to our feedback. He provided, and continues to provide, exceptional support and has made every effort to ensure that we are able to successfully use this tool."</p>
